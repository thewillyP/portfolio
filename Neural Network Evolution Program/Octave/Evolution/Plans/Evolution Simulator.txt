Genetic Evolution of Neural Networks.

Simple forward NN with Back propagation ability.

Evolution Wise:
Genes:
Activation Function
Connection Routes (Can only be feed forward, no loop backs)
lambda
# Of Iterations (cap at 100)

Metric:
Each NN will learn to adapt to it's environment, the one that
learns to do so the best will be the best.

Environment:

Make Alphabet classifiers.

Generation Step:

Spawn 1000 NN randomly
